# About Me
My name is Jan Adell Mill and I graduated in 2023 from the Videogame Design and Development Degree at CITM, UPC.
Although I call myself a developer the truth is I'm mainly interested in conceptual design, user experience and player psychology, with a keen interest in some more practical areas such as QA/Testing
and Level Design as well. My main interest when working in any project is trying to understand why would someone enjoy or want to use what we are presenting them with, and then polishing the conclusions
to that question as much as possible so as to shape our work in the correct direction.
I am also extremely interested in analysis of game design in general as well as writing about it, often just for self satisfaction when it comes to putting my feelings about a game I'm playing into
words.
